# Project Title

Ryan Roman's MS Crawler Coding Challenge 

## Description

The goal of this challenge is to implement a console application that displays the most common words
used in a portion of a webpage.

## Getting Started

### Executing program

unzip files and run the main.py file in terminal using python.


There are 3 optional arguments available:

-url (url to crawl) (defualt = https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft)

-nw (number of most occured words to display) (default = 10)

-ex (words you wish to exclude) (default is None)

### Examples
quick example: "python main.py"

help example: "python main.py -h"

Specific Example: "python main.py -nw 5 -ex microsoft"

## Requirements

The code should be written in C#, Python, or Java.
The code should return the most common words used and the number of times they are used. The
following should be configurable:
- The number of words to return (default: 10)
- Words to exclude from the search
Your code (only the source code, no binaries) should be returned as a zip posted within the contractor
hub tool along with your resume. The code should build into an executable console application.

## Page to crawl

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft
 (Only words from the section “history” should be accounted for.)
